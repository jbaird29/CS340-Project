    <!--
    It should be possible to INSERT entries into every table individually.
-->
    <!--
    Every table should be used in at least one SELECT query. For the SELECT queries, 
    it is fine to just display the content of the tables, but your website needs to also 
    have the ability to search using text or filter using a dynamically populated list of 
    properties. This search/filter functionality should be present for at least one entity. 
    It is generally not appropriate to have only a single query that joins all tables and 
    displays them
-->
    <!--
    You need to include one DELETE and one UPDATE function in your website, for any one of 
    the entities. In addition, it should be possible to add and remove things from at least 
    one many-to-many relationship and it should be possible to add things to all relationships. 
    This means you need INSERT functionality for all relationships as well as entities. And 
    DELETE for at least one many-to-many relationship.
-->
    <!--
    In a one-to-many relationship (like bsg_people to bsg_planets), you should be able to set the 
    foreign key value to NULL (such as on a person in bsg_people), that removes the relationship. 
    In case none of the one-to-many relationships in your database has partial participation, you 
    would need to change that to make sure they can have NULL values.
-->
    <!--
    In a many-to-many relationship, to remove a relationship one would need to delete a row from a table. 
    That would be the case with bsg_people and bsg_certifications. One should be able to add and remove 
    certifications for a person without deleting either bsg_people rows or bsg_certification rows. 
    If you implement DELETE functionality on at least (1) many-to-many relationship table, such 
    that the rows in the relevant entity tables are not impacted, that is sufficient.
